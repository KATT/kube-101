# Helm

Helm can be used to easily deploy complex services on Kubernetes.

You can either download from the [repositor](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/releases)

Or use brew to install it
```
brew install kubernetes-helm
```

You will need to install the tiller component on your cluster by typing `helm init`

You can then install more complex apps, pick one from https://kubeapps.com/ and sail away
